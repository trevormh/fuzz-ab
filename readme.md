# Fuzz-AB

## What is it?
This is a wrapper around [Apache Bench](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html) written in Go to provide it with some basic [fuzz testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing) capabilities. Create a JSON file defining the requests you wish to send (example [here](#sample-request-file)) and fuzz-ab will build all possible combinations of the request variables, turn them into ab requests and execute all of them.

#### For Example...
If you wish to test the url `www.example.com/some_slug/?id=id_value` with multiple values for `some_slug` and `id_value` you can construct an array of options such as `["a","b"]` for `some_slug` and `[1,2]` for `id_value`. All combinations of those values will be constructed into URLs and made into ab calls

`ab www.example.com/a/?param=1`

`ab www.example.com/a/?param=2`

`ab www.example.com/b/?param=1`

`ab www.example.com/b/?param=2`

A summarized output of the stats generated by ab will then be displayed

```
Group 1 - Complete: 100 Failed: 0 Per Second: 780
Group 2 - Complete: 100 Failed: 0 Per Second: 820
Group 3 - Complete: 100 Failed: 0 Per Second: 901
Group 4 - Complete: 100 Failed: 0 Per Second: 879

Summary
Total Complete: 400
Total Failed: 0
Avg Requests Per Second: 845
```




## How to use it

Note: [ab](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html) is required to be installed on your computer this to work. 

1. Create a JSON request file (see [Request File Section](#request-file)) and name it whatever you like.
2. Build with `go build`
3. Run with `./fuzz-ab [options]` (See [options section](#options))

#### [Options](#options)

`-path=` string required. Path to the JSON request file where the ab requests to create and execute are defined.

`-v` optional. When present verbose output will be enabled which displays all of the detailed stats from ab. Without this flag only a basic summary will be displayed.

`request_name` optional string arguments. Names of specific requests from the JSON request file to run separated by spaces. If not provided all requests from the file will be run. 

For example `./fuzz-ab -path=path/to/sample-file.json req2` will run only `req2` from the [sample file](#sample-request-file).

## [JSON Request File](#request-file)

This is the input file used to define the ab requests to make. The file must contain a single JSON object where each key is the name of a request and its value is an object consisting of the following params:

`url` string - required. URL to send request to. Can contain variables specified by strings surrounded by double braces (Ex: `{{VARIABLE_NAME}}`) whose values are provided in the `url-vars` property.

`url-vars` object - optional. JSON object to define values for variables in the URL. Keys are the variable names in the url, values must be array of strings or ints.

`method` string - optional. HTTP method for the request. Defaults to `GET` if not specified.

`ab-options` object - optional. JSON object to define [apache bench](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html) paramaters. Ex: `"ab-options": {"-c": 10}`

`payload` [object - optional]. Payload/body for requests in the form of a JSON object. Can contain variables.

`payload-vars` [object - optional]. JSON object to define values for variables in the payload. Keys are the variable names in the payload, values must be array of strings or ints.


## [Sample Request File](#sample-request-file)

```
This example defines 2 requests, one named req1 and a second named req2.

{
    "req1": {
        "url": "https://www.something.com/route/{{slug_var}}/?some_param={{param_var}}&something={{param_var}}",
        "method": "GET",
        "url-vars": {
            "slug_var": ["value1", "value2", "value3"],
            "param_var": [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0]
        },
        "ab-options": {
            "-n": 10,
            "-c": 5,
            "-C" : "session=123abc",
            "-H": "csrftoken: abc123"
        }
    },
    "req2": {
        "url": "https://www.something.com/{{some_slug}}",
        "method": "POST",
        "url-vars": {
            "some_slug": ["postslug1", "postslug2"]
        },
        "payload": {
            "id": 5,
            "some_values": [1,2,3,4,5],
            "some_param": "{{some_param_value}}",
            "another_param": {
                "property1": 123,
                "property2": "{{property2_value}}"
            }
        },
        "payload-vars": {
            "some_param_value": ["value1", "value2", "value3"],
            "property2_value": [1,2,3,4,5]
        },
        "ab-options": {
            "-n": 5,
            "-c": 2,
            "-H": "csrftoken: token123"
        }
    }
}

```

The above example will be used to generate 60 ab requests between both `req1` and `req2`. 

`req1` has 2 variables - `slug_var` which has 3 values and `param_var` has 10 values for a total of 30 combinations

```
ab -n 10 -c 5 -C "session=123abc" -H "csrftoken: abc123" https://www.something.com/route/value1/?some_param=1&something=1
ab -n 10 -c 5 -C "session=123abc" -H "csrftoken: abc123" https://www.something.com/route/value1/?some_param=2&something=2
...
ab -n 10 -c 5 -C "session=123abc" -H "csrftoken: abc123" https://www.something.com/route/value3/?some_param=0&something=0
```


`req2` has 3 variables: `some_slug` in the url which has 2 values, `some_param_value` in the payload which has 3 values and `property2_value` also in the payload which has 5 values, for a total of 30 combinations (2 * 3 * 5). ab requires payloads to be in a file which it reads from, so fuzz-ab will create json files for all of these payloads in the /tmp/fuzz-ab directory for each run and removes them immediately after running.

```
ab -n 5 -c 2 -H "csrftoken: token123" -T application/x-www-form-urlencoded -p /tmp/fuzz-ab/payload1.json https://www.something.com/postslug1
ab -n 5 -c 2 -H "csrftoken: token123" -T application/x-www-form-urlencoded -p /tmp/fuzz-ab/payload2.json https://www.something.com/postslug1
...
ab -n 5 -c 2 -H "csrftoken: token123" -T application/x-www-form-urlencoded -p /tmp/fuzz-ab/payload30.json https://www.something.com/postslug2
```
